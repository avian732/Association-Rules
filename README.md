# Association-Rules

This project leverages Kroger sales data provided by 84.51 consultants to conduct market basket analysis using R. Association rules are created, which tell us how likely a customer is to buy a certain brand, given that they have already purchased different brand(s) within the data set. Finally, the insights gained in the analysis are considered to design promotional strategies for Kroger.
